# Custom String Functions in C

This project contains my own implementations of basic string operations in C. I wrote them to get comfortable working with pointers, character arrays, and manual memory handling.

## Functions
- `my_strlen` — counts the length of a C-style string  
- `my_strcpy` — copies one string into another buffer  
- `my_strdup` — allocates and returns a duplicate of a string  

## How to Compile
```bash
gcc main.c -o strings
./strings
